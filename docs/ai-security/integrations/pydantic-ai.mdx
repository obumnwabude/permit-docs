# Pydantic AI Integration

**PydanticAI** is a framework that helps developers build structured, typed, and auditable AI agents. It provides strong input/output validation, enforcement hooks, and tool-oriented design patterns. 

This guide demonstrates how to integrate **policy-based authorization** directly into AI agents using an ABAC (Attribute-Based Access Control) model, defining user roles, attributes, and resource permissions, and then enforcing them using Permit's SDKs and Policy Decision Point (PDP).

:::info
This guide uses Permit's [Four Perimeter Model for AI Access Control](/ai-security/framework). 

These perimeters help ensure:

- Only eligible users can interact with your AI agent
- Sensitive data is protected based on user roles
- External actions are never triggered without authorization
- Outputs are policy-compliant before reaching the user
:::

By the end of this tutorial, you'll have a fully operational, policy-governed AI agent with attribute-based authorization.

### Required Credentials

- **Permit API Key** – Available in the Permit.io dashboard under *Settings → API Keys*
- **PDP URL** – Typically `http://localhost:7766` for local PDP; cloud options are available
- **AN Anthropic or OpenAI API Key** for your LLM agent

## Planning Our Policies

Before writing any code, it's important to define the authorization model that governs how your AI agent behaves. 
For this tutorial, we’ll use a financial advisor agent as an example.
We'll later implement our policies using Permit.io's no-code dashboard. 

Here's what our access model looks like from a real-world perspective:

- **Only advises users who explicitly opted in**
- **Only shows financial documents to cleared users**
- **Only allows portfolio actions for premium users**
- **Only appends disclaimers when required**

To create actual policies based on these requirements, let's map out our resources, attributes, actions, and condition/roles/user sets:

### Defining Resources

| Resource Name | Purpose | Key Actions |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `financial_advice` | AI-generated investment suggestions | `receive` |
| `financial_document` | Internal knowledge base documents | `read` |
| `portfolio` | A user's financial assets | `view`, `update` |
| `financial_response` | The AI-generated output shown to the user | `requires_disclaimer` |

Each resource can have attributes that help drive dynamic access checks:

- `financial_document.classification`: `public`, `restricted`, `confidential`
- `financial_response.contains_advice`: `true` or `false`

### Defining User Attributes

| Attribute | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `clearance_level` | `string` | The user's permission tier: `low`, `high`, etc. |
| `opted_in` | `boolean` | Whether the user accepted AI-based financial advice |
| `role` | `string` | Role assigned to the user: `premium_user`, etc. |

### Defining Condition Sets

- **AI Advice Consent Check**:
    
    ```hcl
    user.opted_in == true
    ```
    
- **Document Clearance Match**:
    
    ```hcl
    user.clearance_level == resource.classification
    ```
    
- **Sensitive Portfolio Access**:
    
    ```hcl
    user.role == "premium_user"
    ```
    
- **Response Disclaimer Required**:
    
    ```hcl
    resource.contains_advice == true
    ```
    

### Defining Roles & User Sets

We'll model two main user types:

| Role | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `premium_user` | Can do everything: read docs, get advice, update portfolios |
| `restricted_user` | Read public docs only, no external actions, no advice |

We'll also define:

- **User Sets**:
    - `opted_in_users`: `opted_in == true`
    - `high_clearance_users`: `clearance_level == "high"`
- **Resource Sets**:
    - `confidential_docs`: `classification == "confidential"`
    - `ai_generated_responses`: `contains_advice == true`

Having a clear understanding of the individual elements that comprise our policies, let's define their schema in Permit.io.

## Install and Run the Permit PDP

To perform real-time authorization checks, you'll need to run a local Policy Decision Point (PDP):

```bash
docker pull permitio/pdp-v2:latest

docker run -it -p 7766:7000 \
  --env PDP_API_KEY=<YOUR_API_KEY> \
  --env PDP_DEBUG=True \
  permitio/pdp-v2:latest
```

- Replace `<YOUR_API_KEY>` with your [Permit.io API Key](https://app.permit.io/settings/api-keys)
- The PDP will be available at `http://localhost:7766`

## Permit.io Policy Setup

With our perimeters and policies mapped out, it's time to configure our **authorization schema** in the [Permit.io dashboard](https://app.permit.io/). This includes defining **resources**, **actions**, **user and resource sets**, and **ABAC rules**.

<TimelineWrapper>
  <TimelineStep stepNumber={1}>
    Define Resources
    Go to **Policy → Resources**, and define the following resources via the UI:

    `financial_advice`
    ```json
    {
    "actions": ["receive"],
    "attributes": {
        "is_ai_generated": "boolean"
    }
    }
    ```

    `financial_document`
    ```json
    {
    "actions": ["read"],
    "attributes": {
        "classification": "string", // e.g. public, restricted, confidential
        "doc_type": "string"
    }
    }
    ```

    `portfolio`
    ```json
    {
    "actions": ["view", "update"]
    }
    ```

    `financial_response`
    ```json
    {
    "actions": ["requires_disclaimer"],
    "attributes": {
        "contains_advice": "boolean"
    }
    }
    ```

    ![](/img/ai-security/integrations/pydantic/1.png)

    </TimelineStep>

    <TimelineStep stepNumber={2}>
        Add User Attributes
    Navigate to **Directory → Users → Settings** and define:

    ```json
    {
    "opted_in": "boolean",
    "clearance_level": "string",
    "role": "string"
    }
    ```

    ![](/img/ai-security/integrations/pydantic/2.png)

    ![](/img/ai-security/integrations/pydantic/3.png)

  </TimelineStep>

  <TimelineStep stepNumber={3}>
    Create Condition Sets
    Go to **Policy → ABAC → Condition Sets** and define the following:

    **User Sets:**

    - Opted-in users who can receive AI advice
    - High-clearance users for accessing

    ![](/img/ai-security/integrations/pydantic/4.png)

    ![](/img/ai-security/integrations/pydantic/5.png)

    **Resource Sets**

    - Confidential document classifications
    - AI-generated advice content

    ![](/img/ai-security/integrations/pydantic/6.png)

    ![](/img/ai-security/integrations/pydantic/7.png)

  </TimelineStep>

  <TimelineStep stepNumber={4}>
    **Policy Configuration** <br/>
    Here is what our [**Permit.io**](http://permit.io/) policy configuration dashboard looks like:

    ![](/img/ai-security/integrations/pydantic/8.png)

  </TimelineStep>

  <TimelineStep stepNumber={5}>
    **Use a Script Instead** (Optional): <br/>
    We can also set up the configuration by running the `config.py` file in the project repo:

    ```python
    python config.py
    ```

    This creates:

    - All required resources, attributes, and roles
    - Sample condition and resource sets
    - A usable policy matrix with attached rules

    </TimelineStep>
</TimelineWrapper>

Once Permit.io is configured, you're ready to start building a secure AI agent with **PydanticAI + Permit**.

## Prompt Filtering

Before a user query reaches the AI agent, we need to validate that it's allowed. **Prompt filtering** ensures:

- Users can only request actions they're authorized for
- Risky or sensitive prompts (like financial advice) are only handled for verified users
- Unauthorized queries are rejected early, before reaching the model

In this implementation, we'll validate that users are:

- **Explicitly opted in** for AI-generated financial advice
- Not requesting prohibited actions (e.g. investing guidance without consent)

### How It Works

1. **Classify Prompt Intent** – Detect whether a query is seeking financial advice
2. **Check Permissions** – Use Permit to confirm the user has opted in
3. **Block or Allow** – If allowed, continue. If not, return a denial message

**Code Example**: `validate_financial_query` <br/>
This function is called before processing user input in the agent:

```python
@financial_agent.tool
async def validate_financial_query(
    ctx: RunContext[PermitDeps],
    query: FinancialQuery,
) -> Union[bool, str]:
    """SECURITY PERIMETER 1: Prompt Filtering
    Validates whether users have explicitly consented to receive AI-generated financial advice.
    """
    try:
        # Classify the user's intent
        is_seeking_advice = classify_prompt_for_advice(query.question)

        # Perform the permission check with Permit.io
        permitted = await ctx.deps.permit.check(
            {"key": ctx.deps.user_id},
            "receive",
            {
                "type": "financial_advice",
                "attributes": {
                    "is_ai_generated": is_seeking_advice,
                },
            },
        )

        if not permitted:
            return (
                "User has not opted in to receive AI-generated financial advice."
                if is_seeking_advice
                else "User is not authorized for this type of query."
            )

        return True

    except PermitApiError as e:
        raise SecurityError(f"Prompt permission check failed: {str(e)}")
```

### Classifying Financial Prompts

Here's the simple keyword-based prompt classifier:

```python
def classify_prompt_for_advice(question: str) -> bool:
    advice_keywords = [
        "should I", "recommend", "advice", "suggest",
        "what's the best", "help me choose", "better option"
    ]
    question_lower = question.lower()
    return any(keyword in question_lower for keyword in advice_keywords)
```

:::tip
You can replace this with a more robust NLP-based intent classifier later.
:::

### Expected Behavior

| User | Prompt | Allowed? | Reason |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Alice (opted-in) | "Should I invest in bonds?" | ✅ | Advice is allowed |
| Bob (not opted-in) | "What's a safe investment?" | ❌ | Advice blocked |
| Carol (opted-in) | "Tell me today's market news" | ✅ | Not advice-related |
| Dave (restricted) | "What's the best strategy?" | ❌ | Advice detected, no opt-in |

## Data Protection

Once a user passes the prompt filtering stage, we need to restrict what information the AI agent can access based on the user's permissions.

This layer ensures:

- AI agents can only read documents a user is cleared for
- Sensitive knowledge (e.g., confidential reports, internal analysis) is never leaked to unauthorized users
- Each AI query dynamically filters the documents it sees

### How It Works

1. The user's request references a set of documents
2. Permit checks each document's classification against the user's clearance level
3. Only authorized documents are passed to the AI agent for context and generation

**Code Example**: `access_financial_knowledge` <br/>
This function runs before injecting documents into the AI's prompt or tool execution:

```python
@financial_agent.tool
async def access_financial_knowledge(
    ctx: RunContext[PermitDeps],
    query: FinancialQuery
) -> List[str]:
    """SECURITY PERIMETER 2: Data Protection
    Filters knowledge base access based on document classification and user clearance.
    """
    try:
        resources = [
            {
                "id": doc.id,
                "type": "financial_document",
                "attributes": {
                    "doc_type": doc.type,
                    "classification": doc.classification,
                },
            }
            for doc in query.documents
        ]

        # Use Permit to filter accessible documents
        allowed_docs = await ctx.deps.permit.filter_objects(
            ctx.deps.user_id,
            "read",
            {},
            resources
        )

        allowed_ids = {doc["id"] for doc in allowed_docs}
        return [doc.content for doc in query.documents if doc.id in allowed_ids]

    except PermitApiError as e:
        raise SecurityError(f"Failed to filter documents: {str(e)}")
```

### Document Model & Classifications

Each document is modeled with a sensitivity level:

```python
class FinancialDocument(BaseModel):
    id: str
    type: str  # e.g., "report", "chart", "transcript"
    classification: str  # "public", "restricted", "confidential"
    content: str
```

Permit.io will match the classification against user permissions to decide if the content can be shared.

### Expected Behavior

| User | Document Classification | Access |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Alice (`clearance: high`) | `confidential` | ✅ |
| Bob (`clearance: low`) | `confidential` | ❌ |
| Carol (`clearance: medium`) | `restricted` | ✅ |
| Dave (`clearance: none`) | `public` | ✅ |

This protects high-value data from being included in LLM prompts or output unless the user is explicitly allowed to see it.

## Secure External Access

Your AI agent may interact with external systems — like APIs, databases, or third-party services — to retrieve or modify real-world data. This perimeter ensures those actions are only allowed when explicitly authorized.

This is especially critical for high-impact operations, such as **portfolio updates, bank transactions, sensitive customer record edits, and triggering external workflows or webhooks.**

**Code Example**: `check_action_permissions` <br/>
This tool checks whether the user is allowed to perform a particular external action (e.g., updating a portfolio):

```python
@financial_agent.tool
async def check_action_permissions(
    ctx: RunContext[PermitDeps],
    action: str,
    context: UserContext
) -> bool:
    """SECURITY PERIMETER 3: Secure External Access
    Controls permissions for sensitive financial operations, such as modifying a portfolio.
    """
    try:
        return await ctx.deps.permit.check(
            ctx.deps.user_id,
            action,
            {"type": "portfolio"}
        )
    except PermitApiError as e:
        raise SecurityError(f"Failed to check portfolio update permission: {str(e)}")
```

This is a lightweight but powerful enforcement check — it runs before any real-world interaction.

### Real-World Scenarios

| **User Attributes** | **Attempted Action** | **Allowed?** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `membership: basic` | Modify investment portfolio | ❌ Denied |
| `membership: premium`, `verified: true` | Modify investment portfolio | ✅ Allowed |
| `membership: premium`, `verified: false` | Modify investment portfolio | ❌ Denied |

This ensures that portfolio updates (or any other external action) are never executed unless all security conditions are satisfied.

### Combining with External APIs

This works in tandem with any service call:

```python
if await check_action_permissions(...):
    # Proceed to call API
    result = await client.put("/portfolios/123", json=payload)
else:
    raise SecurityError("Unauthorized portfolio update attempt.")
```

## Response Enforcement

Even when the inputs, data, and actions are secure, **the final AI-generated response** must be validated before it's shown to the user. This ensures the AI doesn't **leak sensitive data, violate regulations** (e.g., offering financial advice without disclaimers)**,** or **create legal liability due to unfiltered content.**

**Code Example**: `validate_financial_response` <br/>
This PydanticAI tool intercepts and inspects the final AI response before it's sent to the user:

```python
@financial_agent.tool
async def validate_financial_response(
    ctx: RunContext[PermitDeps],
    response: FinancialResponse
) -> FinancialResponse:
    """SECURITY PERIMETER 4: Response Enforcement
    Ensures all financial advice responses meet regulatory requirements
    and include necessary disclaimers.
    """
    try:
        contains_advice = classify_response_for_advice(response.answer)

        permitted = await ctx.deps.permit.check(
            ctx.deps.user_id,
            "requires_disclaimer",
            {
                "type": "financial_response",
                "attributes": {"contains_advice": str(contains_advice)},
            },
        )

        if contains_advice and permitted:
            disclaimer = (
                "\n\nIMPORTANT DISCLAIMER: This is AI-generated financial advice. "
                "This information is for educational purposes only and should not be "
                "considered professional financial advice. Always consult a qualified advisor."
            )
            response.answer += disclaimer
            response.disclaimer_added = True
            response.includes_advice = True

        return response

    except PermitApiError as e:
        raise SecurityError(f"Failed to check response content: {str(e)}")
```

### Response Classification

The system uses a simple keyword-based classifier to identify financial advice:

```python
def classify_response_for_advice(response_text: str) -> bool:
    advice_indicators = [
        "recommend", "should", "consider", "advise",
        "suggest", "best option", "strategy", "allocation"
    ]
    return any(keyword in response_text.lower() for keyword in advice_indicators)
```

:::tip
You can replace this with more advanced NLP or moderation APIs in production.
:::

Once implemented, this perimeter gives you full confidence that **every answer shown to your users is policy-compliant**.

## Running the Agent & Testing Behavior

With everything implemented, you're ready to run the AI agent and verify that its behavior matches your fine-grained policies. This section walks you through setting up the environment, launching the agent, and testing different user roles and permissions.

<TimelineWrapper>
  <TimelineStep stepNumber={1}>
    Start the Permit PDP
    Run the Permit Policy Decision Point (PDP) locally to enable real-time policy evaluations:

    ```bash
    docker pull permitio/pdp-v2:latest

    docker run -it -p 7766:7000 \
    --env PDP_DEBUG=True \
    --env PDP_API_KEY=<YOUR_API_KEY> \
    permitio/pdp-v2:latest
    ```

    :::tip
    Replace `<YOUR_API_KEY>` with your key from Permit.io dashboard → Settings → API Keys.

    You may also use the cloud PDP by setting `PDP_URL=https://cloudpdp.api.permit.io`.
    :::
    
  </TimelineStep>

  <TimelineStep stepNumber={2}>
    Launch the Agent
    Clone the repo and install dependencies:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/permitio/langchain-permit  # Update if different
    cd langchain-permit/pydantic-ai-examples
    poetry install  # Or use `pip install -r requirements.txt`
    ```

    Then start the secure financial agent:

    ```bash
    poetry run python -m pydantic_ai_examples.secure_ai_agent
    ```

    This will start a CLI tool that simulates user queries and applies all four perimeters during execution.
  </TimelineStep>

  <TimelineStep stepNumber={3}>
    Environment Setup
    Ensure you have the required environment variables in a `.env` file or export them manually:

    ```
    PERMIT_KEY=your-permit-api-key
    PDP_URL=http://localhost:7766
    ```

    These will be automatically loaded by the agent using `dotenv`.
  </TimelineStep>

  <TimelineStep stepNumber={4}>
    Try Simulated Users
    Use test users with different roles and attributes to observe how the perimeters respond:

    **Fully Authorized Premium User:**

    ```json
    {
    "sub": "user-001",
    "attributes": {
        "membership_tier": ["premium"],
        "clearance_level": "confidential",
        "opted_in": true}
    }
    ```

    Result: Can access documents, request advice, execute actions, and see disclaimers when needed.

    **Limited Basic User**

    ```json
    {
    "sub": "user-002",
    "attributes": {
        "membership_tier": ["basic"],
        "clearance_level": "restricted",
        "opted_in": false}
    }
    ```

    Result: Blocked from advice, sensitive documents, and bookings.
  </TimelineStep>

  <TimelineStep stepNumber={5}>
    Test Inputs & Validate Results

    Try asking:

    - "What's the best investment strategy in a recession?"
    - "Can I get a breakdown of my current portfolio?"
    - "What documents do I need to file taxes as a freelancer?"

    Then watch:

    - The input gets classified
    - Permissions are checked
    - Data is filtered or denied
    - Responses are validated and modified with disclaimers if needed

    :::tip
    You can view allow/deny logs in the Permit Audit Logs panel for each perimeter in real time.
    :::

  </TimelineStep>
</TimelineWrapper>

| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Ask for financial advice | ✅ Allowed (with disclaimer) | ❌ Blocked | ❌ Blocked |
| Access confidential docs | ✅ Allowed | ❌ Blocked | ❌ Blocked |
| Modify investment portfolio | ✅ Allowed | ❌ Blocked | ❌ Blocked |
| Generic public info | ✅ Allowed | ✅ Allowed | ✅ Allowed |

## Final Thoughts & Resources

By combining **PydanticAI** and **Permit.io**, you've implemented a layered access control model that protects every part of the agent workflow: from what users say, to what data the model uses, what it's allowed to do, and how it responds.

By following this guide, you've learned how to:

- **Model fine-grained ABAC policies** in Permit.io using attributes like `membership_tier`, `opted_in`, and `clearance_level`
- **Enforce Prompt Filtering**: Block unauthorized input before it reaches the LLM
- **Apply Data Protection**: Dynamically filter documents based on user roles
- **Secure External Access**: Authorize sensitive operations like portfolio updates
- **Validate Responses**: Ensure compliance with disclaimers and advice checks

This architecture ensures your AI agents respect organizational rules, user permissions, and regulatory boundaries, without sacrificing flexibility or developer experience.
