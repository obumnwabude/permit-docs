# MongoDB RAG Integration

**MongoDB RAG Integration** lets you build a secure Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system using MongoDB, Permit.io, and LangChain. This guide walks you through setting up a policy-enforced AI agent that retrieves and generates responses based on user identity and permissions—ensuring agents only access data they're authorized to see.

:::info
This guide uses Permit.io's [Four Perimeter Model for AI Access Control](/ai-security/framework) to ensure:
- Only eligible users can interact with your AI agent
- Sensitive data is protected based on user roles
- External actions are never triggered without authorization
- Outputs are policy-compliant before reaching the user
:::

By the end, you'll have a fully operational, policy-governed RAG pipeline with attribute-based authorization.

:::

## Quickstart

<TimelineWrapper>
  <TimelineStep stepNumber={1}>
    **Set Up Vector Search in MongoDB Atlas**
    
      - Create a new project and cluster (Free M0 tier is fine).
      - Create a **secure_rag** database and **documents** collection.
      - Go to **Search Indexes** → **Create Search Index** → **Vector Search**.
      - Paste the following JSON in the configuration:
    
    
    ```json
    {
      "fields": [
        {"numDimensions": 1536, "path": "vector_embedding", "similarity": "cosine", "type": "vector"},
        {"path": "metadata.department", "type": "filter"},
        {"path": "document_id", "type": "filter"}
      ]
    }
    ```
    
      - Click Save and wait for the index to build.
    
  </TimelineStep>
  <TimelineStep stepNumber={2}>
    **Clone the Project & Add Your .env File**
    
      - Clone the repo:
    
    
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/permitio/permit-mongodb-secure-rag.git
    cd permit-mongodb-secure-rag
    ```
    
      - Create a `.env` file in the root and add your credentials:
    
    
    ```env
    MONGODB_URI=<your-mongodb-uri>
    OPENAI_API_KEY=<your-openai-api-key>
    PERMIT_API_KEY=<your-permit-api-key>
    PERMIT_PDP_URL=http://permit-pdp:7000
    ```
  </TimelineStep>
  <TimelineStep stepNumber={3}>
    **Run Everything**
    
      - Start all services with Docker Compose:
    
    
    ```bash
    docker-compose up --build
    ```
  </TimelineStep>
</TimelineWrapper>

:::info This Will:
- Start the Permit PDP locally
- Sync markdown docs to MongoDB
- Generate embeddings for each document
- Sync metadata, users, departments & ReBAC policies to Permit.io
- Start the LangChain FastAPI server
:::


## Test the RAG Query API

Query endpoint:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/query \
 -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
 -d '{"query": "Tell me about 2024 budget", "user_id": "user_marketing_1"}'
```

Try querying as:
- `carol` → `user_marketing_1` (viewer in marketing)
- `alice` → `user_engineering_1` (viewer in engineering)

## Project Structure

| Folder/File | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `docs/` | Markdown documents grouped by department |
| `watcher/` | Syncs docs to MongoDB & triggers embedding generation |
| `scripts/` | Permit ReBAC setup (policies, departments, users) |
| `app/` | LangChain API logic (FastAPI powered) |
| `Dockerfile*` | Docker setup for each service |

## How Permissions Work

- Each markdown file contains frontmatter metadata (e.g., department, confidential)
- This metadata is synced to Permit.io as resource instances
- When a user makes a query, LangChain asks Permit.io which documents they can access
- MongoDB vector search filters based on permitted IDs only
- The final response is generated using OpenAI from **only** allowed docs

## In-Depth Project Overview

Secure RAG combines Retrieval-Augmented Generation with Role-Based Access Control (ReBAC) to ensure that an AI agent only retrieves and generates responses from data a user is authorized to access. This project integrates:

- **MongoDB Atlas**: Stores documents and their embeddings for RAG, with vector search and database indexing for efficient retrieval.
- **Permit.io**: Manages access control using a ReBAC model to enforce permissions based on user identity and department.
- **LangChain**: Provides the framework for building the RAG pipeline, connecting MongoDB for retrieval and OpenAI for generation.
- **Docker Compose**: Orchestrates the services (MongoDB, Permit PDP, LangChain app, and file-watcher).

## Key Features

- **Secure Retrieval**: Retrieves only documents a user is permitted to access, based on their identity and department.
- **File Syncing**: A file-watcher service monitors the docs directory for changes and syncs Markdown files to MongoDB.
- **Policy Tagging**: Syncs document metadata to Permit.io as resource instances with attributes like department and confidential.
- **Immediate RAG Availability**: Newly added files are synced to MongoDB and immediately available for RAG queries.

## MongoDB Atlas Setup

<TimelineWrapper>
  <TimelineStep stepNumber={1}>
    **Create a MongoDB Atlas Cluster**

      - Sign up/login to MongoDB Atlas.
      - Create a new cluster (e.g., Cluster0) in your preferred region (e.g., AWS Singapore).
      - Use the free tier (M0 Sandbox) for this demo.
    
  </TimelineStep>
  <TimelineStep stepNumber={2}>
    **Create the Database and Collection**
    
      - In your cluster, go to the **Collections** tab.
      - Create a database named `secure_rag`.
      - Add a collection named `documents`.
    
  </TimelineStep>
  <TimelineStep stepNumber={3}>
    **Set Up Vector Search Index**
    
      - Go to the **Atlas Search** tab in your cluster.
      - Click **Create Search Index** and select **Vector Search**.
      - Use the JSON editor to create an index named `vector_index` with the following configuration:
    
    
    ```json
    {
      "fields": [
        {
          "type": "vector",
          "path": "vector_embedding",
          "numDimensions": 1536,
          "similarity": "cosine"
        },
        {
          "type": "filter",
          "path": "metadata.department"
        },
        {
          "type": "filter",
          "path": "document_id"
        }
      ]
    }
    ```
    
    :::info component info
    - `vector_embedding`: Field storing document embeddings (1536 dimensions for OpenAI embeddings).
    - `cosine`: Similarity metric for vector search.
    - `metadata.department`: Enables pre-filtering by department.
    :::

  </TimelineStep>
  <TimelineStep stepNumber={4}>
    **Set Up Database Index on `document_id`**
    
      - Click **Next** and **Create Index**. Wait for the index status to show as "READY".
      - Go to the **Indexes** tab in the `secure_rag.documents` collection.
      - Click **Create Index** (not "Create Search Index").
    

    **Use the following configuration:**

```
Field: document_id
Type: 1 (asc)
Options:
- Check "Create unique index".
- Index name: document_id_index.
- Leave "Create TTL" unchecked.
```

    
      - Click **Create Index**.
    
    
    This index improves performance for lookups and updates on `document_id`, which is used as a unique identifier.
  </TimelineStep>
  <TimelineStep stepNumber={5}>
    **Get the MongoDB Connection URL**
    
      - In the Atlas UI, click **Connect** on your cluster.
      - Choose **Connect your application**.
      - Copy the connection string - e.g:
      ```
      mongodb+srv://&lt;username&gt;:&lt;password&gt;@cluster0.mongodb.net/secure_rag?retryWrites=true&w=majority
      ```
    
      - Replace `&lt;username&gt;` and `&lt;password&gt;` with your Atlas credentials.
    
  </TimelineStep>
</TimelineWrapper>

## Permit.io Policy Setup
To enable authorization in our RAG, we have to configure policy rules in Permit.io. 
For the sake of this tutorial, we will set up a [Relationship-based Access Control (ReBAC)](/how-to/build-policies/rebac/overview) model that includes implicit permissions granted using role derivations.

<TimelineWrapper>
  <TimelineStep stepNumber={1}>
    **Sign Up/Login to Permit.io**
    
    - Go to [Permit.io](http://app.permit.io/) and sign up or log in.
    - Create a new project (e.g., SecureRAGDemo).
  </TimelineStep>
  <TimelineStep stepNumber={2}>
    **Define Resources and Roles**
    
    - Go to the **Policy Editor** in the Permit.io UI.
    - Define the following resources and roles:
      - Resource: `department` (no actions needed)
      - Resource: `document` (action: `read`)
      - Role: `viewer` (permission: `document:read`)
  </TimelineStep>
  <TimelineStep stepNumber={3}>
    **Create Department Instances**
    
    - Go to **Resources** > **department**.
    - Click **Create Resource Instance**.
    - Set the key to `engineering`, the tenant to `default`, and add the attribute name: "Engineering Department".
    - Repeat for:
      - `department:marketing` (Attributes: name: "Marketing Department")
      - `department:finance` (Attributes: name: "Finance Department")
  </TimelineStep>
  <TimelineStep stepNumber={4}>
    **Create Users**
    
    - Go to the **Users** tab.
    - Click **Create User**.
    - Set the key to `alice`, and the email to `alice@example.com`.
    - Repeat for `bob` (`bob@example.com`).
  </TimelineStep>
  <TimelineStep stepNumber={5}>
    **Assign Roles to Users**
    
    - Go to **Role Assignments**.
    - Click **Assign Role**.
    - Select user `alice`, role `viewer`, and resource `department:engineering`.
    - Repeat for `bob` with `department:marketing`.
  </TimelineStep>
  <TimelineStep stepNumber={6}>
    **Define Role Derivations**
    
    - Go to the **Policy Editor**.
    - Add a role derivation to inherit permissions:
      - If a user has the `viewer` role in `department:X`, they inherit `document:read` for documents where the department is the parent of the document.
      - Example: User with `viewer` in `department:engineering` can read all documents where `department:engineering` is the parent.
  </TimelineStep>
  <TimelineStep stepNumber={7}>
    **Get Permit API Key and PDP URL**
    
    - Go to **Settings** > **API Keys** in Permit.io.
    - Generate an API key and copy it.
    - The PDP URL is typically `http://permit-pdp:7000` (as defined in `docker-compose.yml`).
  </TimelineStep>
</TimelineWrapper>


## Automating Your Permit.io Setup with Scripts

If you prefer to automate the setup of resources, roles, departments, users, and relationships in Permit.io, you can use the provided scripts instead of configuring everything manually via the UI. After running these scripts, you’ll only need to define the role derivation manually in the Permit.io UI.

<TimelineWrapper>
  <TimelineStep stepNumber={1}>
    **Install Script Dependencies** <br/>
    The scripts require the `permit` package. Install it using:

      ```bash
      pip install permit
      ```
  </TimelineStep>
  <TimelineStep stepNumber={2}>
    **Set Environment Variables for Scripts** <br/>
    Ensure `PERMIT_API_KEY` and `PERMIT_PDP_URL` are set in your `.env` file:

      ```env
      PERMIT_API_KEY=<your-permit-api-key>
      PERMIT_PDP_URL=http://permit-pdp:7000
      ```
    :::info Permit API Key
    You can get the `PERMIT_API_KEY` from the Permit.io UI under **Settings > API Keys**.
    :::

  </TimelineStep>
  <TimelineStep stepNumber={3}>
    **Run the Setup Scripts**
    
    - Set Up ReBAC Model: <br/>
      Run `setup_rebac.py` to define resources (`department`, `document`), roles (`viewer`), and relationships:

        ```bash
        python setup_rebac.py
        ```
    - Create Departments: <br/>
      Run `setup_departments.py` to create department instances (`department:engineering`, `department:marketing`, `department:finance`):

        ```bash
        python setup_departments.py
        ```
    - Create Users and Assign Roles: <br/>
      Run `setup_users.py` to create users (`alice`, `bob`) and assign roles (e.g., `alice` as `viewer` in `department:engineering`):

        ```bash
        python setup_users.py
        ```
  </TimelineStep>
  <TimelineStep stepNumber={4}>
    **Manually Define Role Derivation in Permit.io UI**
    
    - The scripts set up resources, roles, and relationships, but you need to define the role derivation manually.
    - Go to the **Policy Editor** in the Permit.io UI.
    - Add a role derivation:
      - Resource: `document`
      - Role: `viewer`
      - Condition: User has role `viewer` in `department` AND `department` is `parent` of `document`.
    :::info
    This ensures that a user with the `viewer` role in a department (e.g., `department:engineering`) can read documents where that department is the parent.
    :::
  </TimelineStep>
  <TimelineStep stepNumber={5}>
    **Verify Setup** <br/>
    In the Permit.io UI, check:
      - **Resources > department** for department instances.
      - **Resources > document** for document instances (after syncing documents).
      - **Users** for `alice` and `bob` with their role assignments.
      - **Policy Editor** for role derivation.
  </TimelineStep>
</TimelineWrapper>

### Environment Variables

**Create a .env File**: <br/>
In the project root, create a `.env` file with the following variables:

```
MONGODB_URI=<your-mongodb-atlas-uri>
OPENAI_API_KEY=<your-openai-api-key>
PERMIT_API_KEY=<your-permit-api-key>
PERMIT_PDP_URL=http://permit-pdp:7000

```

## Running the Project

<TimelineWrapper>
  <TimelineStep stepNumber={1}>
    **Clone the Repository**
    Clone the repo and navigate to the project directory:
      ```bash
      git clone https://github.com/permitio/permit-mongodb-secure-rag.git
      cd permit-mongodb-secure-rag
      ```
  </TimelineStep>
  <TimelineStep stepNumber={2}>
    **Install Dependencies**
    
    - For Dockerized services, dependencies are installed automatically when you build the containers.
    - For manual scripts, install dependencies with:

      ```bash
      pip install -r requirements.embeddings.txt
      pip install -r requirements.txt
      ```
  </TimelineStep>
  <TimelineStep stepNumber={3}>
    **Spin Up Services with Docker Compose** <br/>
    Start all services:

      ```bash
      docker-compose up --build
      ```
    
    :::info
    This will start:
    - `permit-pdp`: Permit.io Policy Decision Point
    - `file-watcher`: Monitors the `docs` directory and syncs files to MongoDB
    - `langchain-app`: The Secure RAG API, accessible at `http://localhost:8000`
    :::
  </TimelineStep>
  <TimelineStep stepNumber={4}>
    **Sync Documents to Permit.io**
    
    - The file-watcher will sync docs to MongoDB automatically.
    - To sync docs to Permit.io, run:

      ```bash
      python sync_documents.py
      ```
    - Update the `file_path` in `sync_documents.py` to the document you want to sync (e.g., `./docs/engineering/api_design.md`).
  </TimelineStep>
  <TimelineStep stepNumber={5}>
    **Generate Embeddings for Documents** <br/>
    Run the following to generate embeddings for all documents and store them in MongoDB:

      ```bash
      python generate_embeddings.py --all
      ```
  </TimelineStep>
  <TimelineStep stepNumber={6}>
    **Test the Secure RAG API** <br/>
    Query the API with a user ID to test Secure RAG:

      ```bash
      curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/query \
        -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
        -d '{"query": "What is API design?", "user_id": "alice"}'
      ```
    `alice` (engineering) can access engineering docs; `bob` (marketing) cannot.
  </TimelineStep>
</TimelineWrapper>

## Final Thoughts & Resources

:::tip How Permissions Enable Secure RAG

**User Identity**: 
- The API receives a `user_id` (e.g., alice) in the query request.

**Permission Checks**:
- The LangChain app queries Permit.io to determine which documents alice can read.
- Permit.io evaluates the ReBAC policy and returns a list of accessible document IDs.

**Filtered Retrieval**:
- LangChain queries MongoDB Atlas, filtering by the permitted document IDs and the user's query (e.g., "What is API design?").
- MongoDB performs a vector search on the `vector_embedding` field to retrieve relevant documents.

**Answer Generation**:
- The retrieved documents are passed to OpenAI to generate a context-aware answer.
- Only content from permitted documents is used in the response.

This ensures that sensitive data is only accessible to authorized users, making the RAG system secure.
