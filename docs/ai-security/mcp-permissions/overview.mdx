# MCPermit â€“ The Permissions Gateway for Agentic AI Tools (MCPs)

MCPermit is a security gateway that provides instant control and visibility over every Model Context Protocol (MCP) server interaction. With a single configuration change, it wraps AI agents' tool access in enterprise-grade security, offering identity-based access checks, comprehensive audit trails, and human-in-the-loop approvals-all without requiring SDKs or code changes.

## The Challenge: Uncontrolled AI Agents and Invisible Risks

Enterprise adoption of agentic AI is surging, but security controls haven't kept pace. Teams deploy and consume MCP servers - the "USB-C for AI" that lets LLM agents plug into apps and data-without consistent oversight. Traditional API gateways and IAM tools were never designed for autonomous, context-driven agents.

Organizations and CISOs face critical questions:
- Which AI agents are touching which systems?
- What data are they accessing?
- Who ultimately authorized those actions?

## The Solution: MCPermit Gateway

MCPermit acts as a smart proxy between AI agents (MCP clients) and the tools or data they seek (MCP servers). It authenticates, authorizes, and audits every interaction, functioning as a zero-trust checkpoint for AI actions:

1. **Authenticate** the originator (human) and the agent acting on their behalf
2. **Authorize** the requested action against fine-grained policy
3. **Audit** the outcome for compliance and threat-hunting

All this happens transparently-no modification to AI agents or MCP servers, just a URL switch.

## Key Capabilities

### Fine-Grained ReBAC, Identity-Based Access Control
- Combine user identity, agent identity, and resource scope in one policy
- Enforce true least-privilege down to individual MCP functions

### Unified Policy Management
- One central policy layer instead of scattered configs
- Rules consistently apply to internal or third-party MCP servers

### Complete Visibility & Auditing
- Real-time logs of every agent action with rich context
- Immediate traceability for incident response and compliance reporting

### Human-in-the-Loop Workflows
- Configurable step-up approvals for sensitive operations
- Optional but critical when AI touches high-risk data or funds

### Enterprise Integration
- Leverages existing SSO (OIDC, SAML, LDAP)
- Aligns agent permissions with HR groups and existing role structures

### Zero-Code Deployment
- Works as a proxy; adopt by routing MCP traffic to the gateway
- Roll out governance in minutes, even across dozens of AI integrations

### Compliance Assurance
- Enforce data-privacy rules (GDPR, HIPAA) and strengthen SOC 2 controls
- Stop unauthorized PII access or data exfiltration before it happens

## Current Security Risks & Compliance Gaps

1. **Lack of Visibility & Oversight**
   - AI agents often act with powerful access yet leave no usable logs
   - Makes malicious or mistaken actions hard to detect

2. **Unauthorized Actions & Privilege Abuse**
   - Over-permissive agents can delete data, transfer funds, or leak secrets
   - Risks from error, prompt injection, or insider threat

3. **Shadow IT in AI Form**
   - Teams spin up MCP integrations in minutes
   - Bypasses standard review and creates unvetted connections

4. **Compliance & Data-Privacy Violations**
   - Unchecked agent activities risk breaching GDPR, HIPAA, and SOC 2
   - Particularly concerning for PII or regulated data access

5. **Operational Chaos & Security Drift**
   - Manual processes can't keep pace with agent sprawl
   - Leads to mismatched policies and difficulty in incident forensics

## Example Authorization Flow

Clicking **Authorize Agent** will authorize the agent to access the MCP server, redirect to the external tools' OAuth flow, and then back to the agent's configured callback URL.
