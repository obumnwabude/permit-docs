## What is MCPermit?

MCPermit adds a permissions layer to any Model Context Protocol (MCP) server by routing traffic through the gateway at `https://mcp.permit.io`. This ensures every AI-agent call is:

- **Authenticated** – ties together user & agent identities
- **Authorized** – enforced with fine-grained ReBAC
- **Audited** – full log plus anomaly alerts
- **Optionally approved** – human-in-the-loop (HITL) for risky operations

All these capabilities are managed through a single console interface.

## Core concepts

### Key components

| Term            | Meaning in MCPermit                                             |
|-----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Originator**  | Human user delegating authority to an agent                     |
| **Agent**       | MCP client acting on behalf of an originator                    |
| **MCP Server**  | Tool endpoint that implements the MCP spec (e.g., Gmail-MCP)    |
| **Gateway**     | MCPermit proxy enforcing policy at `mcp.permit.io`              |
| **PDP**         | Embedded policy engine (OPA + OPAL)                             |
| **Project / Environment** | Config scope in the UI (e.g., *My-App / Prod*)           |
| **On-Behalf-Of** | Relationship linking originator ↔ agent ↔ server               |

### How it works

1. **Gateway routing**: All MCP traffic flows through the gateway
2. **Policy enforcement**: The PDP evaluates each request against defined policies
3. **Audit logging**: All actions are logged for compliance and monitoring
4. **Human oversight**: Optional approval workflows for sensitive operations

## Setting up MCPermit

### Initial gateway setup

1. **Create an organization**
   - Sign in via company SSO
   - Create new organization

2. **Configure deployment**
   - Choose between hosted or self-hosted
   - Set up in **Settings ▸ Gateway**

3. **Connect identity**
   - Configure OIDC/SAML
   - Map groups to roles in **Settings ▸ Identity**

4. **Define policies**
   - Configure allowed agent-type ↔ server-type pairs
   - Set up in **Policy Builder**

5. **Team setup**
   - Invite development team
   - Assign appropriate roles

### URL structure

Hosted URL pattern:
```
https://mcp.permit.io/<org>/<env>/<service>
```

Self-hosted deployments maintain the same path structure behind your domain.

## Managing permissions

### Server registration

1. **Add MCP server**
   - Navigate to *Dashboard ▸ MCP Servers ▸ ➕ Register*
   - Select server type (`personal`, `corporate`, `sensitive`)
   - Configure gateway URL
   - Update reverse-proxy or server config

2. **Agent configuration**
   ```bash
   export MCP_BASE_URL=https://mcp.permit.io/acme/prod
   python run_my_agent.py
   ```

### Function configuration

In *MCP Servers ▸ server ▸ Functions*:
- Toggle **Requires identify_self** (default ON)
- Tag functions with descriptive labels
- Configure approval requirements

## Monitoring and auditing

### Activity monitoring

- View agent activity in **Detect ▸ Logs**
- Filter by specific agents or time periods
- Monitor for anomalies and security events

### Access management

- Review and manage agent delegations
- Configure step-up approvals for sensitive operations
- Revoke access when needed

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom                           | Likely Cause                              | Fix                                                    |
| --------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| **403 – identify_self required**  | Agent skipped `identify_self`             | Ensure SDK auto-invokes or call manually               |
| **No agents visible**             | Delegation incomplete                     | Resend approval link in **Agents ▸ Pending**           |
| **Timeouts**                      | Self-hosted gateway cannot reach the PDP  | Check OPAL side-car or switch to embedded PDP          |
| **Missing logs**                  | Log sink offline                          | **Settings ▸ Logging** → test sink or use local store  |

## Conclusion

MCPermit provides a comprehensive permissions layer for MCP servers, enabling secure and auditable AI agent operations. By routing traffic through the gateway and enforcing fine-grained policies, organizations can maintain control over their AI operations while enabling innovation.
